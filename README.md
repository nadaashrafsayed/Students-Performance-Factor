# Students-Performance-Factor
The data is showcasing the students' performance and what kind of factors can affect them according to their exam score.  
One of the factors is parents invovlment where it showd how the moderate the involvment the higher is the score. Why moderate? the reason for this is because low involment would make the student feel ignored and the high invovlment would make the student feel forced to study
Another factor is peer influence which means the type of environment surroneded the student, from my insights, the positive environment the higher the exam score. So, the students need to be surrounded by positive enviornemnt giving them the spirit to continue their studies to achieve high scores
In conclusion, the moderate parents incolvment the higher exam score and the positive environment the higher the exam score.
